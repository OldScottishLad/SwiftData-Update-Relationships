**SwiftDataUpdateRelationships** is an Apple **Swift Framework** sample application. SwiftUI and **SwiftData** was used to develop this Application. There are cases where a **Many Model**, may need, to have their relationships to **One Models** updated.

When developing an App Store Application a best practice might be to add user settings, that will be used throughout the life of the Application. Pickers could then be used to update the **Many Model** relationships to **One Model** data. A user would then be able to add and edit data, including **SwiftData** relations to a family of SwiftData.
